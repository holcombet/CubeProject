# CubeProject
A portfolio for the puzzle cube project, made in January 2022 by Talitha Holcombe.

All modeling was done from scratch, using [this model](https://www.printables.com/model/27882-fully-3d-printed-rubiks-cube) as a reference.

### Materials and Methods:

The size of the colored tiles were reduced to 69% and the other pieces were reduced to 70% of their original size to better mimic the size of a puzzle cube. The colored tiles were printed using a Stratasys J850 printer. All other pieces were printed using Form 3 SLA 3D printers.
